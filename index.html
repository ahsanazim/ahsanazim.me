    <p id="bio">Hi, my name is Ahsan Azim<br><br>I'm "from" Lahore, Pakistan, although
      my dad's job has meant that I've lived variously in New York, the Netherlands,
      and (kind of) Italy!<br><br> Currently, I'm a sophomore at Dartmouth. I'm
      studying Computer Science, Math, and Government studying. I really enjoy
      each of those subjects, and plan for a career that somehow mixes at least
      two of the three!</p>
    <div id="text_info">
    <p id="cs_info">I created this website for my web dev class at
      Dartmouth. I've never done web development before, so it currently only uses
      html and some rudimentary CSS. I'm planning to add some javascript too!</p>
    <p id="future_plans"> Later, once the course is over, I may adapt this website to my own needs.
      I'm not sure what I'll have up there - maybe descriptions of various
      personal projects? <br><br> For now, here's a
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahsanazim1">link </a>
      to my linkedin page!
